## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main purpose of the project is to utilize Emscripten toolchains to understand how to get wasm working in browser. Specifically, I used Emscripten `emcc` to compile C++ code to WebAssembly and learn to make use of the 'glue code' in order to execute wasm files on website.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the whole, .wasm files are best used in situations where there are demanding-task-processing functions written in high performance languages but not native to browser environment, for example C or C++, and those lines of code are executed frequently. In such cases, we can compile them to webAssembly and achieve near-native performance. For example, Figma is a complex UI/UX designing web tool that performs most of its visual processing in low level language (eg C), in order to yield good user experience, developers can pre-compile functions to web assembly and release great burden on server-side processing. Note that the best scenario is the functions to be compiled have a fixed amount of parameters, so that the input is optimized with Javascript.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this project, we are going to build an online C/C++ code editor in which the server handles wasm compilation and all the execution is done on browser.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>


These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

You will need to clone the project to your local remote.

```
git clone https://github.com/...
```

### Installing

Get the server running from the main folder with the following command


```bash
npm start
```

and get the application running in the client folder with

```bash
npm run dev
```


## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

+ **Step 1:** Code some C/C++ lines to the Editor part.

+ **Step 2:** Hit the Compile button.

+ **Step 3:** If your code requires input, type or paste into the `Input` section.

+ **Step 4:** Click run and the output will show up.
